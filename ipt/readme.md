# Irish Public Transport App Project

## Introduction

> The goal is to build a simple easy to use, amazing looking, Public information app for Irish public transport. This app will use Cordova 7.1.* and Angularjs 1.5.*/1.6.* (tbc). The API will be powered by data.gove.ie and smartdublin.ie [The data will be un-edited or modified ever] <br/> I've decided to start this project as I believe the GUI and ways people access this public API for Irish Transport should be better. The current applications are functional but not user friendly as of June 2018
